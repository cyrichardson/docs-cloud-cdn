General API Information
-----------------------

The Rackspace CDN API is implemented using a RESTful web service interface. Like other Rackspace services, Rackspace CDN shares a common token-based authentication system that allows seamless access between Rackspace products and services.

.. note::
    All requests to authenticate against and operate the service are performed using SSL over HTTP (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.
